Description: Aspect importanceâ€™s aim is to increase the interpretability of the 
    black box model by providing instance-level explainer for the groups of 
    explanatory variables. It enables grouping predictors into entities called 
    aspects. Afterwards, it can calculate the contribution of those aspects to 
    the prediction.
