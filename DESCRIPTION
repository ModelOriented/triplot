Description: Tools for exploration of machine learning predictive models. 
    Focuses on increasing interpretability of black box models that contain many 
    correlated values. Delivers an instance-level explainer that  
    supports calculating the importance of the whole groups of explanatory 
    variables. Package also provides triplot - tool that illustrates how the 
    importance of groups of predictors changes depending on the size of those 
    groups.
