Description: Tools for exploring effects of correlated features in predictive 
    models. The predict_triplot() function delivers instance-level explanations 
    that calculate the importance of the groups of explanatory variables. The 
    model_triplot() function delivers data-level explanations. The generic plot 
    function visualises in a concise way importance of hierarchical groups of 
    predictors. All of the the tools are model agnostic, therefore works for any
    predictive machine learning models. Find more details in Biecek (2018)
